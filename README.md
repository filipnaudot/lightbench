# LLM Benchmark Framework

## Human Evaluation
Human evaluation is straightforward with the interactive chat interface, enabling users to interact with the model in real-time and assess its responses in a conversational setting.

### Chat Example
Example of a chat using [Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct), running on a GTX 1080 TI.

## Automatic Evaluations
This framework supports automatic evaluation for:
1. **Code Generation**: Measure the model's ability to generate syntactically correct and functional code.
2. **Text Generation (Question Answering)**: Evaluate the model's performance in answering questions using the LLM-as-a-judge technique.


## Getting Started
**1. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands:**
```bash
bash install_dependencies.sh
```
This script **creates a Python virtual environment** and installs all required dependencies within it.

**2. Activating the Virtual Environment**

After running the installation script, you can activate the virtual environment using the command provided at the end of the script.

**3. Creating the .env File**

To enable the framework to function correctly, you need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project. The file should include the following keys:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=
MODEL_NAME=
```
`OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key, required for text evaluation.

`HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`: Your Hugging Face token, used for all evaluations if you are not using your own model loader.

`MODEL_NAME`: Specifies the model to use in the **chat.py** script for interactive chat.
